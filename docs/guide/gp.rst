Gaussian Processes
==================

The determination of periodicities using Gaussian Processes has been getting somewhat trendy as of recent years. In the area of astrophysical time series analysis, it's been used with varying degrees of success to study stellar magnetic cycles (timescale of years) and stellar rotation (timescale of days), none of which are strictly periodic processes.
