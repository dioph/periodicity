## Installation

The latest version is available to download via PyPI: __`pip install periodicity`__.

Alternatively, you can build the current development version from source by cloning this repo (__`git clone https://github.com/dioph/periodicity.git`__) and running __`pip install ./periodicity`__.

## Development

If you're interested in contributing to periodicity, install __pipenv__ and you can setup everything you need with __`pipenv install --dev`__.

To automatically test the project (and also check formatting, coverage, etc.), simply run __`tox`__ within the project's directory.
